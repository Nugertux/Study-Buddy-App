# StudyBuddy

## Project Overview
StudyBuddy is a web-based platform that connects students with compatible study partners. The app allows users to create profiles, securely log in, swipe through other studentsâ€™ profiles (Tinder-style), and chat with matches. The goal is to make finding study partners simple, interactive, and personalized.
